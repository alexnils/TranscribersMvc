# Tajik and Uzbek transcriber
This is a web app for transcribing Tajik and Uzbek texts in Cyrillic into the Latin script. This is an ASP.NET core project, so the conversion is done on the backend using C#.

For an overview of how the different scripts correspond to one another, see [page 18](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1637778/FULLTEXT01.pdf#page=18) of my dissertation [Evidentiality in Tajik](https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1637778&dswid=3362).
